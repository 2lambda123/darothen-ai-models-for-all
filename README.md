# `ai-models` For All

This repository is intended to provide a template that users can adapt to start generating their own weather forecasts leveraging the "pure AI" NWP systems recently developed and open-sourced by Huawei, Nvidia, and Google DeepMind. We boot-strap on top of the fantastic [`ai-models`](https://github.com/ecmwf-lab/ai-models) repository published by ECMWF Labs, but implement our own wrappers to help end-users quickly get started generating their own forecasts.
